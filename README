These files are solutions I've found to the problems at projecteuler.net. They're numbered according to the problem number on the site. I'm working through the problems in order of difficulty, so solutions won't appear in order. Some problems won't have solutions here due to triviality in Haskell/Python or my using someone else's algorithm.
