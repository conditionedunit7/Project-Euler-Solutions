--Given a matrix and a list of numbers, add those numbers to the matrix in a 
--spiral pattern, going counterclockwise. This can be converted to a clockwise-
--building matrix as specified by the problem by doing a map of the transform 
--method, but it's not necessary since the diagonals of odd-sided matrices will 
--be the same. The matrix won't necessarily be square if the list of numbers is 
--the wrong length.
